# Rewards Summary Page

## Project Overview

- The Rewards Summary Page is designed to allow users to:

    * Track their earnings from bookings.
    * View a detailed history of cashback transactions.
    * Cash out rewards through direct withdrawal or promo code conversion.

- This project was initially intended to be developed using ReactJS, but as I'm currently in the process of learning React, I have implemented the solution using vanilla JavaScript for now. Once I am more comfortable with React and with mentorship, I will be more than happy to later migrate the project to React library.

## Features

1. Earnings Overview

    - Displays total cashback earned.
    - Shows the current balance available for withdrawal or conversion.
    - Includes a progress bar indicating earnings status.

2. Cashback History

    - Provides a list of past transactions, including:
        - Transaction date.
        - Amount earned.
        - Brief booking details.

3. Cashout Options

    - Users can choose between:
    - Direct Cashout to their bank account.
    - Conversion to Promo Code for future use.

4. User Interface

    - A responsive design ensures the page looks good across different screen sizes.
    - The header is fixed at the top of the page, allowing easy navigation between sections.
    - Accessible buttons for cashout actions with modals or confirmation dialogs.

## Stack

* HTML: Structure of the page.

* CSS: Styling and layout, including a clean UI with a gradient for the header text and hover effects on links.

* JavaScript: Handles functionality for:

    - Populating dynamic data (earnings, transactions).
    - Managing button clicks for cashout options.
    - Animating the progress bar for visual clarity.

## My Future Goals

- Migrate to ReactJS: Once I've completed learning React, this project will be rewritten as a React application to take advantage of component-based architecture and state management.

- Backend Integration: In the future, the page will be connected to an API to retrieve real data for earnings, transactions, and cashout actions.

## Internship Context

*This was a required task provided as part of an internship opportunity, and I am in the process of improving the project while learning React. It showcases my current skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on frontend development.*
